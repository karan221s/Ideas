“I refuse to walk carefully through life only to arrive safely at death”.
-Paulo Coelho

"You reap what you sow"

"Fake it till you make it"

It is your disability that you can't handle a situation.

Everyboy has challenges in life. Life is not fair to anybody. But what is right (Dharma) is know to your conscience.
"No matter how much unfairness we got, how many times we were disgraced, how many times were denied what was due to us, … What is imp is, How you reacted at that time"
"Life's unfairness does not give you license to walk the wrong path of iniquity"

A quote from Martin Luther King Jr. :
“Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.”
